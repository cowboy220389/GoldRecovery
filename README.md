# GoldRecovery

To begin, I imported libraries and loaded the datasets.

I then did some eda and filled missing values

Next was calculating if the rougher output recovery values that were provided were correct.
This was done by calculating the Mean Absolute Error from a slice from that specific column.
The check showed very little noticable error, so I noted this and then moved on.

The next step was visualization of the different metals during each stage of the recovery proccess
A histogram with contrasting colors was used

Next functions for smape and fsmape were declared and I had a little help on this from a tutor named Han
